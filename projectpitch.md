Travel / Weekend Planner Idea-  

What do you usually do one week before a trip (or a free weekend at home)? -Check the weather, start making a packing list, check restaurant options, search “top 10 things to do in this town,” search Facebook for events, email your friends/family your ideas?

My idea for the student project is to create a website that helps prepare for an upcoming trip all in one place.  On the site, you will be able to enter the dates and location you are staying.  You answer some demographics and desired activity questions to help plan.  (i.e. camping, museums, nightlife…). TBD whether users will create a profile and sign in to store preferences, or continue as guest.  

The app will connect to several API’s to pull info such as weather, events, and nearby deals:
-List from Facebook Events-what is going on in town- live music, exhibits, yoga in the park etc? 
-8COUPONS API – this is a mashup of Groupon, Living Social, etc. for deals such as kayak rentals and whale watching trips.  
-If time allows- connect to the Yelp API for a limited display of the top-rated restaurants within walking/driving distance. 

-A custom-built API will include information to generate packing suggestions based upon the information received, which you can edit- add to or delete from, check off once you pack it. 

This site will keep everything you need on one place – the weather, your packing list, and the events/deals it returned.  Once you have this list, you can share it with others, or refer to it during your trip rather than checking multiple sites each day.  




USER STORIES- 
-As a user, I want the events during my visit organized in one location so that I don’t have to research once I get to my destination. 
-In order to plan my weekend, I want to see local events in advance.  
-As a traveler, I want to know what we will experience so I can pack accordingly.
-As a user of the planner, I can view the weather and events, so that I can decide how to plan my time. 
-As a traveler, I want to be able to send a list to my friends, so that we don’t have to duplicate research.
